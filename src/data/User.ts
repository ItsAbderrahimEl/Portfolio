    I'm a person who enjoys building and protecting modern web applications.
</p>

<p>
    I work on creating systems that are secure, reliable, and easy to maintain, with careful attention to performance and code quality.
</p>

<p>
    My experience combines security testing with hands-on development, which helps me understand both how applications work and how they can be attacked.
</p>

<p>
    I care about writing clean code, reusing components where possible, and designing interfaces that feel clear and intuitive for users.
</p>

<p>
    I’m a continuous learner based in Morocco, open to new opportunities, collaboration, and meaningful conversations.

    I am often asked why I chose to specialize in both Web Development and Penetration Testing.
</p>

<p>
    The answer lies in the strong overlap between these two disciplines and how they reinforce each other.
</p>

<p>
    Understanding how applications are built provides a clear advantage when testing them, while security
    expertise enables me to identify vulnerabilities early and design more secure, reliable systems.
