    I'm a
    <span class="font-bold">Penetration Tester</span>
    and
    <span class="font-bold">Full-stack Developer</span>
    with a passion for web applications and security.

    I have significant achievements in both fields, including ranking among the top 1% in Hack The Box Academy,
    along with building numerous web applications designed with security, usability, and maintainability in mind.
</p> <p>
    Creating reusable components and ensuring clean, modern designs are always key priorities for me in web
    development.</p> <p>
    I enjoy learning new things and am always excited about discovering new projects to create or systems to break into.
    I'm a Muslim currently living in Morocco and would love the opportunity to work with you—or share a cup of coffee,
    whichever you prefer.

    I've asked myself this question many times: why do I want to specialize in both Web Development
    and Penetration Testing? Isn't that too much?
</p> <p>
    Well, that's a great question. To answer it, we first need to understand the significant overlap
    between the skills required for both fields. For instance, knowing how to develop web applications
    gives you a huge advantage when it comes to testing them. Similarly, having knowledge of penetration
    testing
    and cybersecurity lets you identify common vulnerabilities in modern applications,
    which, in turn, helps you build more secure and reliable web applications.

    So yes, it might seem like a lot, but I believe I’m capable of excelling at both. With determination
    and perseverance.
    <span class="font-bold">I am determined to achieve this goal.</span>
