    I am often asked why I chose to specialize in both Web Development and Penetration Testing.
</p>

<p>
    The answer lies in the strong overlap between these two disciplines and how they reinforce each other.
</p>

<p>
    Understanding how applications are built provides a clear advantage when testing them, while security
    expertise enables me to identify vulnerabilities early and design more secure, reliable systems.
</p>

<p>
    While demanding, this dual focus aligns with my capabilities and long-term goals.
    <span class="font-bold">I am fully committed to excelling in both areas.</span>
